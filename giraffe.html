                    <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, known for their long necks, unique coat patterns, and calm behavior. They can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall, with their neck alone being nearly 2 meters (6 feet) long!</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their height, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans — just seven — but each vertebra is much longer. Their long necks help them reach leaves high up in trees, especially acacia trees, which are their favorite food.</p>

                    <p>Giraffes are social animals and live in loose groups called towers. They have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from a distance. Their calm and gentle nature makes them a favorite among visitors.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G15, near the tall tree grove in the savannah zone.</p>
