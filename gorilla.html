                    <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, closely related to humans, sharing about 98% of our DNA. They are gentle, intelligent, and social animals that live in family groups called troops.</p>
                    
                    <p>Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo. A dominant male silverback leads the troop and protects the group, guiding their movements and maintaining order.</p>

                    <p>Our gorilla enclosure is home to Kong and his troop. Despite his powerful size, Kong is friendly and loves interacting with visitors from a distance. Gorillas communicate with a variety of sounds and gestures, and you'll likely see them lounging, grooming, or playfully tumbling around.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen G08, near the rainforest dome on the west side of the zoo.</p>
