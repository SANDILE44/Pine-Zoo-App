                    <h3>KOALAS</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are arboreal marsupials native to eastern Australia. Known for their fluffy ears, spoon‑shaped noses, and calm demeanour, they spend most of their lives in eucalyptus trees.</p>
                    
                    <p>Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are tough and low in nutrients. To conserve energy, they sleep up to 18–20 hours a day. Each koala has a “home range” of favourite trees that it rarely leaves.</p>

                    <p>Although they look cuddly, koalas have sharp claws for climbing and can be quite picky about which eucalyptus species they eat. Their thick fur helps them stay warm during cool nights high in the canopy.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the koalas in pen K04, inside the eucalyptus grove in the Australasia section.</p>
