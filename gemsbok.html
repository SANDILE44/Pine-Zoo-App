                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The Gemsbok, also known as the Oryx gazella, is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa such as the Kalahari Desert. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, spear-like horns, bold black-and-white facial markings, and sturdy build.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both males and females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm (33 inches) long and are used for defense and dominance displays. Gemsbok live in herds and are highly adapted to dry environments. They can survive for long periods without drinking water by deriving moisture from the plants they eat.</p>

                    <p>Their thick skin helps protect them from the harsh sun, and their pale fur reflects sunlight. These graceful creatures are a symbol of strength and resilience in the desert environment.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the Gemsbok in pen A12, near the desert biome exhibit.</p>
