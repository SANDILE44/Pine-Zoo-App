                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>The warthog is a wild member of the pig family, recognizable by its large, curved tusks and facial “warts”—which are actually thick growths of skin used for protection during fights. These animals might look odd, but they are tough and perfectly adapted for life on the African savannah.</p>

                    <p>Warthogs feed on grasses, roots, and berries, and they often kneel on their front legs while grazing. They use their tusks for digging and defense against predators like lions and leopards. When threatened, warthogs can run surprisingly fast, often with their tails sticking straight up!</p>

                    <p>Despite their appearance, warthogs are social animals, usually seen in small groups called sounders. They also take over abandoned burrows to rest and raise their young.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W07, close to the entrance of the Savannah Trail exhibit.</p>
