                    <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                    <p>Our lively troop of monkeys is always ready to entertain with acrobatics, chatter, and curiosity. They’re highly intelligent primates, using their dexterous hands and strong tails to swing, leap, and explore every corner of their habitat.</p>
                    
                    <p>Monkeys are omnivores, enjoying a varied diet of fruits, leaves, insects, and the occasional small treat from their caretakers. Social structure is important— watch them groom each other, share food, and even play pranks!</p>

                    <p>Listen closely and you’ll hear an impressive repertoire of calls, hoots, and squeaks used for communication. Each monkey has its own personality: from the mischievous youngsters to the wise, calm elders.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen M11, beside the canopy walkway in the rainforest section.</p>
