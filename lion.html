                    <h3>LIONS</h3>
                    <p>The lion is often called the “King of the Jungle,” though it actually thrives on grassland savannahs. Lions live in prides—family groups headed by dominant males and made up of related females and their cubs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Males are recognizable by their majestic manes, which grow darker and fuller with age. Females (lionesses) are the primary hunters, working cooperatively to bring down prey such as antelope, zebra, and buffalo.</p>

                    <p>Despite their regal appearance, lions spend much of the day resting to conserve energy for nighttime hunts. A pride’s roar can be heard up to 8 km (5 mi) away, serving as a territorial warning and a way to locate family members.</p>
                    
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the lions at pen L02, located in the heart of the savannah enclosure.</p>
