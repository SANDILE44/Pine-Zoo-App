                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>Giant pandas are one of the most beloved animals in the world, known for their distinct black-and-white fur and gentle nature. They are native to the mountain forests of central China and are a symbol of conservation efforts globally.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pandas are mostly solitary and spend their days eating bamboo, their primary diet, which they consume in large amounts—up to 12–38 kg (26–84 lb) every day. Despite their bear classification, they rarely show aggression and are quite calm in nature.</p>

                    <p>Pandas communicate through vocalizations and scent markings, and while they appear cuddly, they are strong climbers and swimmers. Pandas are also known for their playful behavior, making them a favorite among zoo visitors.</p>

                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the pandas at pen B19, near the bamboo forest exhibit and beside the Koala sanctuary.</p>
